# HackCovid_19
I made this project during pandemic to know the cases of covid Positive patients in different areas of India. In this project we use to give input as State/City name 
and this code tell us the total number of positive , recovered and died patients due to covid . This gives us result verbally . This code automatically reads or 
web scrap the needed information from https://www.mohfw.gov.in/ regularly to provide correct data.
